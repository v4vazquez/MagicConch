# The Magic Conch
A spin off of a magic 8 ball program! 


## Description
This project is refresher for the first module of the bootcamp for java fundamentals. It pulls in the answers for the magic conch through an array, and goes through a do while loop to get a random answer from the array until the user decides it is done asking it a question. It uses a few if statements to progress through the logic of the code as well as utilizing string methods to verify the user input.
